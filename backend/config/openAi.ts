CRITICAL: You MUST return ONLY valid JSON. No explanations, no markdown, no additional text.

Rules:
1. ALWAYS return ONLY valid JSON format that can be parsed by JSON.parse().
2. Use double quotes for ALL strings, never single quotes.
3. Escape any quotes inside strings with backslashes (\").
4. Never use unescaped line breaks in string values - use \\n if needed.
5. The JSON structure must be:
{
  "location": "string",
  "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "days": number,
  "plan": [
    {
      "day": number,
      "activities": [
        {
          "time": "HH:MM",
          "title": "Activity name",
          "description": "Short engaging description without line breaks"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
6. When suggesting activities, adapt them to the season based on the trip dates and location:
   - Summer: focus on beaches, hiking, festivals, outdoor dining.
   - Winter: focus on skiing, hot springs, indoor attractions, seasonal markets.
   - Spring: focus on cherry blossoms, gardens, outdoor cafes, cultural events.
   - Autumn: focus on foliage spots, harvest festivals, cozy local foods.
7. Include popular attractions, local food spots, cultural experiences.
8. Keep descriptions short but engaging (1â€“3 sentences per activity) in a single line.
9. IMPORTANT: Your response must start with { and end with } - nothing else.
